# 🧠 ExcercismLearning

Welcome to **ExcercismLearning** — a personal repository documenting my journey to become a **Machine Learning Algorithm Engineer**. I use this space to practice and deepen my understanding of programming languages through exercises from Exercism.

## 🎯 Goal

My primary objective is to build strong foundations in programming and computer science, focusing on languages and concepts essential for machine learning, including:

- **Python** – for data science, ML frameworks, and scripting
- **C++** – for performance-critical ML algorithms and systems
- **Other languages** – as needed for systems programming, algorithmic thinking, and tooling

## 🧪 What’s Inside

This repo contains my solutions to Exercism exercises, organized by language. Each folder includes:

- ✅ Code solutions
- 📝 Notes and reflections
- 🔁 Alternative approaches or optimizations (when applicable)

## 🧭 Next Steps

As I progress, I plan to:

- Expand into ML-specific projects and algorithms
- Integrate testing and benchmarking practices
- Explore data structures, numerical computing, and optimization

## 📬 Feedback & Collaboration

This is a personal learning space, but I welcome feedback, suggestions, and discussions.  
Feel free to open an issue or reach out!
