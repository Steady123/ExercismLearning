ðŸ§  ExcercismLearning
Welcome to ExcercismLearning â€” a personal repository documenting my journey to become a Machine Learning Algorithm Engineer. I use this space to practice and deepen my understanding of programming languages through exercises from Exercism.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
My primary objective is to build strong foundations in programming and computer science, focusing on languages and concepts essential for machine learning, including:

Python â€“ for data science, ML frameworks, and scripting
C++ â€“ for performance-critical ML algorithms and systems
Other languages â€“ as needed for systems programming, algorithmic thinking, and tooling
ðŸ§ª Whatâ€™s Inside
This repo contains my solutions to Exercism exercises, organized by language. Each folder includes:

My code solutions
Notes and reflections
Occasionally alternative approaches or optimizations
